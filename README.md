# Audira

The only native Mac app for Canary speech recognition.

Audira brings NVIDIA's #1-ranked ASR model to your Mac as a proper native app -- not a CLI,
not Electron, not a web wrapper.

- Record or import -- Drag & drop files or record directly
- Canary-1B-v2 -- Best-in-class accuracy, 25 languages, translation
- 100% local -- Runs on Apple Silicon, no cloud, no subscription
- Native SwiftUI -- Fast, lightweight, feels like a Mac app should
